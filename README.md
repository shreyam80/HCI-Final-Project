# HCI-Final-Project: Travel Express

**Travel Express** is an interactive multi-screen prototype designed for planning trips. The application helps users search for locations (e.g., "Cancun"), view recommendations for restaurants, activities, and attractions, manage their itinerary, read and add reviews, and view a sample profile. This project was developed as part of an HCI course.

## Features

- **Search Functionality:**  
  Users can click the "Search Location" button on the Home screen and type "Cancun" on the Location screen to view sample data.
  
- **Favorites:**  
  Users can "like" locations and view them on the My Likes screen.

- **Itinerary Management:**  
  Users can add locations to their itinerary from any screen and later remove them via the Itinerary screen.

- **Reviews:**  
  Users can view sample reviews, add new reviews, and delete existing reviews.

- **Profile:**  
  A sample Profile page displays user information such as a profile picture, name, email, and a short bio.

- **Navigation:**  
  A bottom navigation bar allows switching between Home, My Likes, Itinerary, Reviews, and Profile screens.
